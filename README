This is a sample mobile app that I wrote to retrieve Google's undocumented and unsupported international weather API.

Change the value of the wx_location variable in Resources/ui.js to change the default location.

This app might be helpful as a component of larger app, such as a conference or "brochure"-type app to show local weather conditions.

This app created using Titanium Mobile.

Known issues:

Currently no error handling.

createActivityIndicator() not working as expected.
